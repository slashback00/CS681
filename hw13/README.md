The original LotterySystemUnsafe version contains a race condition because multiple threads can call purchaseTicket() simultaneously when tickets are available. This can lead to selling more tickets than are actually available if the check of availableTickets happens right before two threads decrement it.

The revised LotterySystemSafe version fixes this by using the synchronized keyword to lock access to purchaseTicket() so only one thread can execute it at a time. This eliminates the race condition and ensures the correct number of tickets are sold.

The Main class shows the race condition happening by starting 15 threads to purchase from a pool of 10 tickets.

So in summary:

-- Application: Lottery ticket purchase system
-- Original version race condition: Multiple unsynchronized threads calling purchaseTicket() and decrementing availableTickets
-- Fix: Synchronized purchaseTicket() method to allow only one thread access at a time
